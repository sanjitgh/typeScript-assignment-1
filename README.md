## Interfaces vs Types

At first glance, `interface` and `type` in TypeScript seem to serve the same purposeâ€”defining the shape of data. However, they have subtle yet important differences.

### âœ… Use Cases for `interface`

- Preferred for defining object shapes.
- Supports extension via `extends` and declaration merging.
- Ideal when building libraries or public APIs.

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

interface Admin extends User {
  role: string;
}
```
